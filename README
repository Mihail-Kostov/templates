Various templates and example code

Files:
  matrix
    Shows example usage of a two-dimensional associative array in bash

  options
    Template for the way I personally parse options in bash, allows both long
    and short options

  parallel
    Example of a function that runs jobs in parallel

  re_replace
    Examples of regex searching and regex search/replace in strings using bash

  sort
    Examples of quicksort and shuffle functions using bash

  threads
    More complex parallel template. Runs N jobs at a time, launching a new one
    as each job finishes

  transpose
    Awk script, transposes a matrix/grid. For example,
      a b c
      e f g
      h i
    will become:
      a e h
      b f i
      c g
    Reads the whole file into memory in order to do so. Change the "FS = OFS ="
    line to alter the field separators. An empty value (at least in gawk) will
    transpose char by char.

  transpose_tmp
    Same as transpose, except uses a temp file instead of reading everything
    into memory.
